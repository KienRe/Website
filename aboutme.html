        Hello there, my name is Rene Kienauer and I love making games. Since I can remember I have always been playing and talking
        about games. Even though I wanted to be a gameplay progammer since I was 10 I did not really pursue this dream until
        much later in life. Now I have found my calling and cant stop thinking about programming and designing them!

        When I am not dreaming up solutions for problems (programming) or dreaming up problems to solve (game design) then I am mostly
        watching all kinds of media I can get my hands on like good movies, lots of Youtube and different Twitch streams.
        I also do a lot of reading on Reddit and Twitter, probably much more than I should. Sometimes even you can find me
        on the outdoors reaching the top of an mountain or going for a run. I also enjoy politics, psychology, boats and
        the occasional party.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <text-center>
        I have been programming now seriously for about three years before that I made some first experiences in the higher technical
        college I visited. I love the feeling of figuring out solutions to problems and then see them work in reality. Even
        though there is still much to learn for me I have the strong feeling that given enough time, no matter how hard the
        problem may seem at first, I can arrive at an working solution!

    <h2>C++</h2>
    <text-center>
        Mostly playing around with different projects. I know how to porgamm and work with it but lack serious project experience with it. I have set
        it as my next goal to just do something in C++ and therefore started tinkering around with making an Game Engine in it. It is very hard but
        I see continous progress and slowly I start geting the hang of it.

    <h2>C#</h2>
    <text-center>
        Most of my C# experience is inside Unity, only some minor experiences building tools in C# with WinForm. The biggest challenges
        I faced were about Maintainability / Readability of the gameplay code architecture.

    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <text-center>
        Since my electrical engineering days I have been a fan of solving math problems. I dont think I am very good at it but nevertheless
        I will keep on trying. Today I mostly deal with practical math problems in form of gameplay equations, easing equations
        and lots of vector math.

    <h2>Unity</h2>
    <text-center>
        In the last two years I learned the in and outs of game development with the Unity Engine. Now after two years of using the
        engine I am confident to say that I am very comfortable with everything Unity related.

    <h2>Game Design</h2>
    <text-center>
        I fell in love with game design at university just because no one else would do it. Slowly I failed my way upward, project
        per project until suddenly the games I made could be interpreted as fun. There is something very fascinating about
        having an initial idea and then iterating on it until someone has fun playing it. SAE Institute allowed me to
        do severall protoypes, game jams and even one physical card game game which all were a massive learning experience!
