        Hello there, my name is Rene Kienauer and I love making games. Since I can remember I have always been playing and talking
        about games. Even though I wanted to be a game progammer since I was 10 I did not really pursue this dream until
        much later in life. Now I have found my calling and can't stop thinking about programming and designing them!

        When I am not dreaming up solutions for problems (programming) or dreaming up problems to solve (game design) then I am mostly
        consuming all kinds of media I can get my hands on like movies, games, books, livestreams and videos. Sometimes even you can find me
        on the outdoors reaching the top of an mountain or going for a run. I also enjoy politics, psychology, boats and the occasional party.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <text-center style="display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap;">
        I love the feeling of figuring out solutions to problems and then see them work in reality. I mainly work with C# inside Unity and
        in my spare time I like to tinker around with C++ and trying to learn Game Engine Development from the ground up. I value the readability 
        and simplicity as the top criteria when writing code but I am also deeply interested in how to write the fastests possible solution (see my 
        Data Oriented Article on the Blog).

    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <text-center style="display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap;">
        Since my electrical engineering days I have been a fan of solving math problems. I dont think I am very good at it but nevertheless
        I will keep on trying.

    <h2>Unity</h2>
    <text-center style="display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap;">
        In the last two years I learned the in and outs of game development with the Unity Engine. After two years of using the
        engine daily I am confident to say that I am very comfortable with everything Unity related and I am able to build any kind of game I want inside the engine.

    <h2>Game Design</h2>
    <text-center style="display: flex; flex-wrap: nowrap;">
        I fell in love with game design at the SAE Institute just because no one else would do it for you. Slowly I failed my way upward, project
        per project. There is something very fascinating about having an initial idea and then iterating on it until someone has fun playing it.
        SAE Institute allowed me to do severall protoypes, game jams and even one physical card game game which all were a massive learning experience!
