    		<p>	Hello there, my name is Rene Kienauer and I love making games. Since I can remember I have always been playing and talking about games.
						Even though I wanted to be a gameplay progammer since I was 10 I did not really
						pursue this pipe dream until much later in life. Now I have found my calling and cant stop thinking about programming and designing them!
				</p>
				<br>
				<p> When I am not dreaming up solutions for problems (programming) or dreaming up problems to solve (game design) then I am mostly watching all kinds
						of media I can get my hands on like good movies, lots of Youtube and different Twitch streams. I also do a lot of reading on Reddit and Twitter, probably much more than I should.
						Sometimes even you can find me on the outdoors reaching the top of an mountain or going for a run. I also enjoy politics, psychology, boats and the occasional party.
				</p>

    		<h4>Programming</h4>
				<p>	I have been programming now seriously for about three years before that I made some first experiences in the higher technical college I visited. I love
						the feeling of figuring out solutions to problems and then see them work in reality. Even though there is still much to learn for me I have
						the strong feeling that given enough time, no matter how hard the problem may seem at first, I can arrive at an working solution!
				</p>
			
				<p><b> Topics </b></p>
				<p> Object Oriented, Data Oriented, Networking, Design Patterns, Game Engine Architecture, Basic OpenGL/DirectX, Git, SVN </p>

				<h4>Mathematics</h4>
					<p> Since my electrical engineering days I have been a fan of solving math problems. I dont think I am very good at it but nevertheless I will keep on trying.
							Today I mostly deal with practical math problems in form of gameplay equations, easing equations and lots of vector math.
					</p>

				<p><b> Topics </b></p>
				<p> Vector Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Transformations </p>

				<h4>Game Design</h4>
		    	<p> I fell in love with game design at university just because no one else would do it. Slowly I failed my way upward, project per project until suddenly
						the games I made could be interpreted as fun. There is something very fascinating about having an initial idea and then iterating on it until it someone has fun playing it.
						SAE Institute allowed me to do severall protoypes, game jams, a card game and even one "finished" game which all were a massive learning expercience!

				<h4>Unity</h4>
		    	<p>	In the last two years I learned the in and outs of game development with the Unity Engine. Now after two years
						of using the engine I am confident to say that I am very comfortable with everything Unity related.

    		<h4>C#</h4>
					<p> Most of my C# experience is inside Unity, only some minor experiences building tools in C# with WinForm. The biggest challenges I faced were about Maintainability / Readability of the gameplay code 
					architecture.
					</p>

				<h4>C++</h4>
				<p> Mostly playing around with different projects. I already tried twice to build an Renderer for an custom game engine but always was sidetracked
						by the game projects because it just took to long. I know how to porgamm and work with it but lack serious experience with it.
				</p>

				<h4>Rust</h4>
				<p> I am currently in the process of trying out Rust and most certainly want to further my knowledege in this language. It is much more pleasant to
						work with than C++ but I recognize that it will take time to be robust enough for game programming.
