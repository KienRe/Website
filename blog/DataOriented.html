        <h1> Why I wrote it?</h1>
        <text-center>
            As part of my games programming education at SAE Vienna we where tasked to write an small article about a topic that interests us.
			The first time I heard about Data Oriented Design was in a talk from the former Lead Engineer at Insomniac (now working at Unity) Mike Acton.
			At the time I did not completly understand how to translate that knowledge into the practical and therefore made it my mission to learn the
            fundamentals of Data Oriented Programming via writing this article.
