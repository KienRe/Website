                Racing game where you are only able to break instead of accelerate. Drive down the junk yard track and try to dodge obstacles
                all while keeping an eye on the constant increasing speed of your shopping cart. Keep the speed in a sweet
                spot where you are simultaneosly fast enough to take the big air jumps and also slow enough to be able to
                dodge hazards and collect new crowbars to be able to brake and steer your shopping cart towards the finish
                line.

                Made for Game Makers Toolkit GameJam 2018 in 48 hours. The theme was Genre without Mechanics. Me, a second programmer and
                only one artist (credit to him for making so much stuff) tried to make a racing game with a twist. I am
                pretty happy with the feeling of speed you get while playing. The most interesting stuff to work on where
                the jumps which are completly faked with the help of bezier curves, this allows for consistent fail and sucess
                landing spots!

                A rythm infinite runner. Tap in sync with the beat while also switching gears at the right time. Keep the rythm and dodge
                obstacles and you will survive till the end! If you miss enough beats or crash into enough obstacles your
                health will lower until eventually you run out of health and fail!

                Made for Global GameJam 2017 in 48 hours. Our team consisted of 2 programmers, 1 sound designer and 2 artists. The game is
                based loosely on the jams theme Transmission. We tried to convey the feeling of what switching gears could
                feel like inside an engine. I worked on everything except syncinc the beat with gameplay which proved to
                be very hard to get right within the constraints of the jam.

                Minigame challenges that have to be beaten without loosing all lives. Are you ready for madness? Trying to beat this game
                will prove a challenge thats for sure. Simple tasks like pluggin in a USB Stick, typing a word or pressing
                a button where never that hard.

                Made for Reversed Festivale GameJam 2017 in 72 hours. This was by far the most chaotic jam I have ever been part of. Our
                team consisted of 8 people which was an absolut nightmare. Trying to steer the ship towards an unified creative
                goal was impossible. Also keeping everyone busy with work proved to be quite a challenge. I learned a lot
                about group dynamics and how the amount of content isnt realy critical for a jam.

                Made for BeansJam 2017 in 48 hours. The theme was Space Mafia. My first GameJam ever! Also the first time I worked in a group
                on a game. After only 3 months experience of making games we decided to jump into the cold water and just
                make something. Pretty happy with the results considering the circumstances. Also learned that the goal survive
                for 5 minutes isnt that engaging for players.
