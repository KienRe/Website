                This project was made as end project at SAE Vienna in about 6 month. The team was 3 programmers and 3 artists strong. I was
                the Project Leader and coordinated most of the meetings and development targets. I worked on every major
                system at least once. The hardest challenges were the networking of the game (making sure that client and server did not desync) and 
                programming the Units in a way where they would be modular enough to allow for great variety in gameplay.I also wrote a little bit about

                Run,Jump,Long Jump, High Jump, Slide, Dash, Swing, Wall Run and Wall Dash your way to the goal. Take advantage
                of the expressive moveset that allows multiple approaches to beat an obstacle in your way in order to beat this epic jump & run. You will have to chain together different moves all that while trying
                to dodge different types of obstacles along the way.

                From concept to finish me and a second programmer spend about 3 months working on this prototype. I mostly worked on the
                character controller and spend a lot of my time to get the different moves feel right and transition to each
                other smoothly. This project allowed me to solidify my linear algebra skills because as I discovered while working on this building a character controller
                involves lots of vector math. I wrote a little post mortem about this prototype <a
                    href="blog/UltimateParkourChallenge_PostMortem.html">which you can read here!</a>
