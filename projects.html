                This project was made as end project at SAE Vienna in about 6 month. The team was 3 programmers and 3 artists strong. I was
                the Project Leader and coordinated most of the meetings and development targets. I worked on every major
                system at least once. The hardest challenge was the networking of the game and making sure that the client
                and the server did not desync. I also wrote a little bit about <a href="#" style="display: inline-flex">
                    failing our way towards an usable User Interface.</a>

                Run,Jump,Long Jump, High Jump, Slide, Dash, Swing, WallRun and WallDash your way to the goal. In this epic jump & run the
                focus is on the expressive moveset. You will have to chain together different moves and all that while trying
                to dodge different types of obstacles along the way.

                From concept to finish me and a second programmer spend about 3 months working on this prototype. I mostly worked on the
                character controller and spend a lot of my time to get the different moves feel right and transition to each
                other smoothly. This project allowed me to solidify my linear algebra skills because each state in someway
                needs to know a angle,direction or position. I wrote a little post mortem about this prototype <a
                    href="#">which you can read here!</a>
