                Animal Squad was made as part of my end project at SAE Vienna in about 6 month. The team was 3 programmers and 3 artists strong. I was
                the Project Leader and coordinated meetings and development targets. I worked on every system at least once but primarly focused on
				Networking (via GameSparks Services), Hexagon Grid System and Player Gameplay code. The hardest challenges were the networking of the game
				(ensuring server and client where in sync) and programming the units in a modular way to allow for great variety in gameplay.

                Run, Jump, Long Jump, High Jump, Slide, Dash, Swing, Wall Run and Wall Dash your way to the goal. Take advantage
                of an expressive moveset that allows for multiple approaches. You will have to chain together different moves all while trying
                to dodge all types of obstacles along the way.

                From concept to finish me and a second programmer spend about 3 months working on this prototype. I mostly worked on the
                character controller and spend a lot of my time trying to get the different moves to feel right. This project allowed me to
				solidify my linear algebra skills because as I discovered while working on this building a character controller
                involves lots of vector math. I wrote a little post mortem about this prototype	 <a
